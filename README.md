# Prodigy Internship Tasks
## üìã Project Overiew
During this internship, I undertook a comprehensive project that included several key data science tasks, aimed at improving my skills and expanding my knowledge. The project encompassed various stages, from data cleaning to advanced analytical techniques such as  Data Cleaning, Data Visulaization, Exploratory Data Analysis, Decision Tree Classifier and Sentiment Analysis on various datasets.
## üìä Key Features
- EDA on FIFA Dataset: Conducted exploratory data analysis to visualize the distribution of key player attributes such as stamina, skills, age, potential, and penalties using histograms.  
- Correlation Analysis on Student Performance Dataset: Performed data preprocessing and cleaning followed by correlation analysis using Seaborn to explore relationships between various performance metrics through heatmaps, pairplots, relplots, distplots, and catplots. 
- Behavioral Analysis using Bank Dataset: Cleaned the dataset, removed unwanted columns, applied label encoding to categorical values, and utilized a decision tree classifier to predict customer product uptake and analyze behavioral patterns.
- Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data: Conducted sentiment analysis to classify tweets as positive or negative using logistic regression, including text preprocessing steps like removing stop words, followed by visualization of results with countplots and word clouds.
## üìÇ Repository Structure
This repository contains the following files:
- `notebooks/`: Directory contains Jupyter notebooks for all 4 tasks.
- `README.me`: File provide with an overview of the project.
## üìù Conclusion

Through comprehensive exploratory data analysis, correlation analysis, machine learning, and sentiment analysis, valuable insights are derived from multiple datasets. The analysis provides a deeper understanding of player attributes in the FIFA dataset, student performance correlations, customer behavior in the bank dataset, and sentiment trends in Twitter data.
